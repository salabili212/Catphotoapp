# Catphotoapp
This is a simple Cat Photo App webpage. It has sections with cat photos, lists of things cats like and dislike, and captions for images. The page ends with a footer linking to freeCodeCamp.

This HTML page is a tiny “CatPhotoApp.” It uses semantic tags main, section, figure, footer to show cat photos and lists. The first section has a heading, two links (one opens in a new tab), and an image of a relaxing cat. The second section shows two lists: things cats love unordered and top 3 things cats hate (ordered). Each list is followed by a <figure> with an image and a caption figcaption. The footer credits freeCodeCamp and says “No Copyright.” The page has clear alt text for accessibility and simple, clean structure.
